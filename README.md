# Gruntfile.min.js

> A collection of short, sample Gruntfile.js files that actually fit in a screen

## What?

I got tired of reading long README files for each Grunt plugin I'm using, just to figure out the minimum Gruntfile configuration that can do the job I need. So I decided to create a repository with a bunch of Gruntfiles, each of which is short enough to fit in a screen. I'd then just copy paste whatever I need to a bigger Gruntfile for my projects.

## Getting Started

Just take a look at root-level directories of this repo.
